\section*{GS:11 Qualifications}
    This is my application for the Equipment Facilities and Services Specialist at NASA Langley Research
    Center (Job Code: 805472500). I have 5 years of experience in various engineering industries. I have
    delivered on several projects, carefully analyzing safety, cost, and manufacturability. I have 8 years
    of experience in fabrication using multiple materials. Electrical design is where I got my start and my skills
    have grown with me into the present day.\\
    \\
    During my employment at TekTone: Sound \& Signal I provided technical support and documentation
    to more than 10 projects during my 4 years of continuous employment. Many of the test fixtures and apparatus that I designed required the usage of production drawings, specifications provided by myself or
    the engineering team, and test reports usually written in Microsoft Word or LATEX. One root cause analysis project, in particular, where I used my report writing skills extensively, helped to save TekTone several
    1000s of dollars in producing corrective parts for one of their high-volume products. I provided equipment
    maintenance on all of the testers I designed at TekTone, but while I was in the manufacturing department
    I was trained in the operation and maintenance of all key equipment in the automation line.\\
    \\
    During my undergraduate education, I further refined and used my engineering skills to great effect. This
    often was commended on all accounts. My achievements in class led me to be handpicked for the Cube-
    Sat capstone project offered during my senior year. I led the mechanical design and fabrication efforts on
    that team, resulting in meeting the goals of our sponsor Destination SPACE Inc. This experience added to
    my knowledge of aerospace engineering.\\
    \\
    My skills and experience have been proven in my career. Based on my experiences I am qualified to
    perform the duties listed in the job description. % Treat the end like a the conclusion of a thesis
